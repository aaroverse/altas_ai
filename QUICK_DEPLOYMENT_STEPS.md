# Quick Deployment Steps

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Subscription Plan Delay ✅

- Added loading state to prevent "Free Plan" flash
- Shows skeleton loader while fetching actual subscription
- Displays correct plan immediately once loaded

### Issue 2: Traveler Pass Cancellation ✅

- Added subscription management view for Traveler Pass users
- Implemented double confirmation dialog
- Created cancellation flow with Stripe integration
- User keeps access until end of billing period

## Deploy Now

### 1. Deploy New Edge Function (Required)

```bash
cd supabase
supabase functions deploy cancel-subscription
```

### 2. Redeploy Updated Webhook (Required)

```bash
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

### 3. Test the App

```bash
# Run your Flutter app
flutter run
```

## What to Test

1. **Loading State:**

   - Open Profile Screen
   - Should see loading skeleton (not "Free Plan" flash)

2. **Free User:**

   - Click subscription card
   - Should see upgrade options

3. **Traveler Pass User:**
   - Click subscription card
   - Should see subscription details with benefits
   - Should see "Cancel Subscription" button
   - Click cancel → First confirmation
   - Confirm → Second confirmation
   - Should see success message
   - Should still have access

## Database Updates Needed

The current schema should work, but you can optionally add cancellation tracking:

```sql
-- Optional: Track when cancellation was requested
ALTER TABLE user_subscriptions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cancelled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

## What Happens When User Cancels

1. **Immediately:**

   - Stripe: `cancel_at_period_end = true`
   - Database: `status = 'cancelling'`
   - User: Sees success message, keeps access

2. **At End of Billing Period:**
   - Stripe: Subscription cancelled
   - Webhook: Receives `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Database: `status = 'inactive'`
   - User: Reverts to Free Plan (3 scans/day)

## Verify in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Customers
2. Find user by email
3. Check subscription shows "Cancels on [date]"
4. Status should be "Active" until that date

## Verify in Supabase

```sql
SELECT user_id, status, end_date, stripe_subscription_id
FROM user_subscriptions
WHERE status = 'cancelling';
```

## Environment Variables (Already Set)

Make sure these are configured in Supabase:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SITE_URL`

## Files Changed

- ✅ `lib/views/profile_screen.dart` - UI updates
- ✅ `lib/services/subscription_manager.dart` - Cancellation logic
- ✅ `supabase/functions/cancel-subscription/` - New edge function
- ✅ `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts` - Webhook updates
