# üîê Authorization Fix Applied

## The Issue

Supabase Edge Functions require authentication by default. The error was:

```
{"code":401,"message":"Missing authorization header"}
```

## The Fix

Added authorization headers to the HTTP request in `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
// Add authorization header for Supabase Edge Function
request.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer ${AppConfig.supabaseAnonKey}';
request.headers['apikey'] = AppConfig.supabaseAnonKey;
```

## What Changed

### Updated File:

- `lib/main.dart` - Added authorization headers to the multipart request

### How It Works:

1. App sends request to Supabase Edge Function
2. Includes `Authorization: Bearer <anon-key>` header
3. Includes `apikey: <anon-key>` header
4. Supabase validates the request
5. Edge Function proxies to your webhook
6. Response flows back to the app

## Status

‚úÖ **Fixed and Deployed**

- Code updated
- App rebuilt
- Pushed to GitHub
- Netlify will auto-deploy in ~1 minute

## Testing

Once Netlify finishes deploying:

1. Visit your app
2. Upload a menu image
3. Should work without the 401 error!

## Security Note

The Supabase anon key is safe to expose in client-side code:

- ‚úÖ It's designed for public use
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) protects your data
- ‚úÖ It only allows operations you've explicitly permitted
- ‚úÖ This is the standard Supabase pattern

## Monitoring

Check the Edge Function logs:

```bash
supabase functions logs process-menu --follow
```

You should see:

- "Processing menu image request..."
- "Target Language: English"
- "File received: Yes"
- "Forwarding to webhook: http://srv858154.hstgr.cloud:5678/..."
- "Webhook response received successfully"

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Wait for Netlify deployment (~1 minute)
2. ‚úÖ Test your app
3. ‚úÖ Should work perfectly now!

## Troubleshooting

If still not working:

### Check Browser Console:

- Look for any new error messages
- Check Network tab for the request details

### Check Function Logs:

```bash
supabase functions logs process-menu
```

### Test Function Directly:

```bash
./test_edge_function.sh
```

## Success Indicators

Everything is working when:

- ‚úÖ No 401 authorization errors
- ‚úÖ No CORS errors
- ‚úÖ Menu images process successfully
- ‚úÖ Results display correctly

The authorization issue is now resolved! üéâ
