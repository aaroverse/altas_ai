# Cancellation Updates - Fixed Issues

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Show Traveler Pass Until Expiration

**Problem:** After canceling, the subscription immediately showed "Free Plan" instead of showing "Traveler Pass" until the end date.

**Solution:**

- Updated `getSubscriptionInfo()` to treat both `'active'` and `'cancelling'` status as active Traveler Pass
- Added `isCancelling` flag to subscription info
- Updated `hasTravelerPass()` to include `'cancelling'` status (user keeps unlimited scans until expiration)
- Modified UI to show:
  - Status: "Cancelling" (in orange)
  - Badge: "PRO" (in orange instead of green)
  - Info: "Until [expiration date]" instead of "Unlimited"
  - Warning banner: "Subscription will end on [date]"

### ✅ Issue 2: Full-Screen Loading During Cancellation

**Problem:** Loading indicator only appeared on profile picture and logout button, looking weird.

**Solution:**

- Wrapped entire Scaffold in a Stack
- Added full-screen overlay with semi-transparent black background
- Shows centered loading spinner with "Processing..." text
- Disables all interactions with `AbsorbPointer` during loading
- Disables back button during loading

## User Experience Flow

### Active Subscription → Cancelling

1. User clicks subscription card
2. Sees subscription details with "Cancel Subscription" button
3. Clicks cancel → First confirmation dialog
4. Confirms → Full-screen loading appears
5. Success → Loading disappears, subscription card updates
6. Card now shows:
   - Orange "PRO" badge
   - "Cancelling" status in orange
   - "Until [date]" instead of "Unlimited"

### Cancelling Subscription View

1. User clicks subscription card
2. Sees:
   - Orange icon (schedule/clock)
   - Warning banner about expiration
   - "Access until" instead of "Renews on"
   - No "Cancel Subscription" button (already cancelled)
   - Still shows all benefits (user has access)

### At Expiration Date

1. Stripe webhook fires `customer.subscription.deleted`
2. Database status changes to `'inactive'`
3. Next time user opens profile:
   - Shows "Free Plan"
   - Shows "3/3 today" scans
   - No PRO badge
   - Can click to see upgrade options

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Active subscription shows green badge and "Active" status
- [x] After cancellation, shows orange badge and "Cancelling" status
- [x] Cancelling subscription shows "Until [date]" on card
- [x] Full-screen loading appears during cancellation
- [x] All interactions disabled during loading
- [x] Back button disabled during loading
- [x] Loading disappears after success/error
- [x] Subscription details show warning banner when cancelling
- [x] "Cancel Subscription" button hidden when already cancelling
- [x] "Renews on" changes to "Access until" when cancelling
- [x] User keeps unlimited scans while status is "cancelling"
- [x] User reverts to Free Plan when status becomes "inactive"

## Database Status Flow

```
active → cancelling → inactive
  ↓          ↓           ↓
Green     Orange      Grey
PRO       PRO         (no badge)
Active    Cancelling  Active
Unlimited Until date  3/3 today
```

## Important Notes

1. **User keeps access:** While status is `'cancelling'`, user has full Traveler Pass access
2. **No refunds:** User paid for the period, gets access until it ends
3. **Can't re-cancel:** Cancel button is hidden once subscription is cancelling
4. **Automatic expiration:** Stripe webhook handles final status change to `'inactive'`
5. **Full-screen loading:** Prevents any interaction during cancellation process

## Deploy

No additional deployment needed beyond what was already documented in `QUICK_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`. The edge function and webhook are already deployed.
