# Production Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Forgot Password Feature** ✅

- Added "Forgot Password?" link in the email login screen
- Users can now request password reset emails
- Reset link is sent to their registered email address

### 2. **Password Reset in Profile** ✅

- Added "Reset Password" button in Profile & Settings
- For OAuth users (Google/Facebook): Shows a message explaining they can't use password login
- For email users: Sends password reset link to their email
- Located above the "Log Out" button

### 3. **OAuth Users and Password Login** ✅

**Important Note**: Users who sign in with Google or Facebook cannot use email/password login. This is by design:

- OAuth accounts (Google/Facebook) don't have passwords in your system
- These users must continue using their social login method
- If they want email/password login, they need to create a separate account with email

**Solution Implemented**:

- When OAuth users try to reset password, they see a clear message explaining this
- The app detects if user signed in via OAuth and shows appropriate messaging

### 4. **Subscription Display Fix** ✅

The subscription check logic is already correct in `subscription_manager.dart`:

```dart
subscription?['subscription_type'] == 'traveler_pass' &&
(subscription?['status'] == 'active' || subscription?['status'] == 'cancelling')
```

**To verify the issue**:

1. Check the database `user_subscriptions` table for the user
2. Verify the `subscription_type` field is exactly `'traveler_pass'` (not `'free'` or other values)
3. Verify the `status` field is `'active'` or `'cancelling'`
4. If a user shows Traveler Pass but database says free, check:
   - Is there a row in `user_subscriptions` for this user?
   - What are the exact values in that row?

### 5. **Consistent MaxWidth Across All Screens** ✅

Applied `maxWidth: 500` constraint to all screens for consistent sizing:

- ✅ Auth Screen (both email auth and social login views)
- ✅ Profile Screen
- ✅ Main App (already had it in main.dart)

All screens now maintain the same maximum width for better UX on tablets and large screens.

## Files Modified

1. `lib/views/auth_screen.dart`

   - Added `_showForgotPasswordDialog()` method
   - Added "Forgot Password?" button in sign-in view
   - Added maxWidth constraint to both auth views

2. `lib/views/profile_screen.dart`
   - Added `_showResetPasswordDialog()` method
   - Added `_buildResetPasswordButton()` widget
   - Added OAuth user detection and appropriate messaging
   - Added maxWidth constraint to profile view

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test forgot password on login screen
- [ ] Test password reset in profile for email users
- [ ] Test password reset in profile for OAuth users (should show message)
- [ ] Verify subscription display matches database
- [ ] Test on tablet/large screen to verify maxWidth consistency
- [ ] Test password reset email delivery

## Database Verification for Subscription Issues

If users are seeing wrong subscription tiers, run this query:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  subscription_type,
  status,
  plan_duration,
  start_date,
  end_date
FROM user_subscriptions
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE';
```

The subscription will only show as "Traveler Pass" if:

- `subscription_type` = `'traveler_pass'`
- `status` = `'active'` OR `'cancelling'`

Otherwise, it will show as "Free Plan".
